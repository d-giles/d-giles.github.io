            <h2>the shortest bio</h2>
            <p>I'm Daniel Giles (he/him/his) from Issaquah, Washington. A graduate from Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, I'm currently doing my Ph.D. in Physics at the <a href="https://science.iit.edu/physics">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> in Chicago, Illinois in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.adlerplanetarium.org">Adler Planetarium</a>, advised by <a href="https://tangledfields.wordpress.com/">Dr. Lucianne Walkowicz</a>.
                <br><br>
                My current field of research is focused on large scale astronomy and attempting the most interesting data, hidden by the sheer volume of surveys that are coming out. As such, on any given day you'll find my nose buried in code fine tuning machine learning algorithms and despairing at the bugs I've accidentally hidden throughout.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The research I currently do is focused on finding anomalous data in large databases. We utilize machine clustering methods to identify the most outlying data in order to find new, interesting phenomena.
