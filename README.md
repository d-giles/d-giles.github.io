# Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Giles (he/him/his).
I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [SETI Institute.](https://www.seti.org/our-scientists/daniel-giles)

I am from Issaquah, Washington, hold a B.S. from Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, and hold a PhD in Physics from the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, Illinois. My current research at the SETI Institute is focused on finding the most interesting (read: anomalous) variables and transients in TESS, alongside creating a census of analogs to Boyajian's star. All of this interesting data can be hidden by sheer volume, so I implement machine learning methods to mine the data. On any given day you'll find my nose buried in code, fine-tuning machine learning algorithms, and despairing at the bugs I've accidentally hidden throughout. Proof of concept paper here.
